Knowing quickly where the ones affected are and what they require can be key for disaster response teams in order to save human lifes. But how to find the right information out of an endless amount of messages such as on the internet or the news?

This project tries to explore how machine learning can help organizations to make better aid and assistance related decisions, especially during and after natural disasters. Below 

## Installation
Despite standard libraries that come with the Anaconda distribution of Python you'll need ```sklearn```,```nltk``` and ```sqlalchemy``` for both model training and web app deployment. Also, you'll need ```flask``` and ```plotly``` in order to successfully run the app. For further information on packages and versions please see the ```r
